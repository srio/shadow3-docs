How SHADOW manipulates electric vectors
15/03/2013 03:55 PM

This document explains how the electric fields and related parameters
(intensity, polarization) are defined and modified in SHADOW. It also
describes a bug fixed in March 2013.

Mosaic crystals in SHADOW: an update
22/03/2013 10:52 AM

This document explains an update of the SHADOW model for mosaic
crystals. The model is described in http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1143784
. This update corrects some problems with the model and fix some bugs
that prevent to use this mosaic crystal option in SHADOW3. ...

Monte Carlo simulation of radiation emitted from the BM ports of the new
ESRF lattice

This document explains a model to Monte Carlo sample wiggler sources.
The model follows the implementation
in the SHADOW ray tracing code. The results are applied to the
simulation of the emission of the wigglers to be used at the bending
magnet beamlines for the new ESRF lattice.
